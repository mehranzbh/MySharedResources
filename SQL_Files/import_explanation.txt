# the import time was exteremly long, I decided to use 'LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE"
# There are two main codes written for this : 1.Creating table 2.importing csv data to the created table

1. Table should be created first

2. importing csv file (using 'LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE')
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'E:\\Agile\\Code and DB\\SQLproject\\carsinfo.csv' INTO TABLE carsinfo
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
(ID,Make,Model,Typee,DriveTrain,MSRP,Invoice,EngineSize,Cylinders,Horsepower,MPG_City,MPG_Highway,Weight,Wheelbase,Length);

I faced an issue in LOAD LOCAL DATA:
ERROR 3950 (42000): Loading local data is disabled; this must be
enabled on both the client and server side.
and solved it using : 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59993844/error-loading-local-data-is-disabled-this-must-be-enabled-on-both-the-client

So the data is now imported.
