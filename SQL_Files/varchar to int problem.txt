--When I tried to change column data type from varchar to int, it didn't work.
ALTER TABLE carsinfo
ALTER COLUMN Invoice Numeric

--So the CAST function should be used and the new column should be replaced with the previous column which had varchar data type.
Select Cast(Cylinders as int) from joinedtables


--for replacing the columns temp table approach has been taken.

--temp table

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temptable
CREATE TABLE temptable 
(Cylindersss int )
 INSERT INTO temptable
 Select Cast(Cylinders as int) from joinedtables

INSERT INTO joinedtables(Cylinderss)
Values ((Select Cast(Cylinders as int) from joinedtables));


SELECT * from joinedtables as jj
INNER JOIN temptable as tt ON jj.Cylinders=tt.Cylindersss;
