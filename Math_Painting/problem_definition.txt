We are going to design an app that can draw squares and 
rectangle in a canvas.

The user specifies the dimentions of the canvas and 
passes the starting point of the square or rectangle
based on the x and y (whichh are the x and y from the top left
of the canvas). shapes also have colors.

The app produces an image and saves it to the desired path.


sqaure:
    x
    y
    side
    colors
    draw(canvas)
    
rectangle:
    x
    y
    height
    width
    colors
    draw(canvas)

canvas:
    width
    height
    color
    make(imagepath)
