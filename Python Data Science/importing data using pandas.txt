## first method - copy file with the path
import pandas as pd
stats = pd.read_csv('E:\Agile\Python Data Science\P4-Demographic-Data.csv')


## second method is to changing working directory and load the data
import os
os.getcwd()   # to get the working path
os.chdir('E:\Agile\Python Data Science')    #changing the path to the path that file exists within
stats = pd.read_csv('P4-Demographic-Data.csv')
