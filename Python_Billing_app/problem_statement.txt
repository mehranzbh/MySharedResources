We want to design an app that get a bill amount, and flatmates' names and days that flatmates
were in the house. Then calculate the amount of money each flatmate should pay, based on the 
number of the days they were in the house.

we also want that the app generates a pdf report that contains the period, and the flatmates 
names with the amount of money each flatmate should pay.
